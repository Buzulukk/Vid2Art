Hello

This script allows you to use a telegram bot that provides a summary of any video! Just send a link to YouTube and get back a summary of the entire video and each of its parts! With pictures and timecodes!


This project was developed during the period from June 23rd to June 25th, 2023, as part of the 'Profbuh hackathon'. So I cannot be held responsible for the further functionality of this code, as it uses many third-party libraries

Also you should put orig_vid.mp4 file of video you wanted to process in the directory with that .py file
